A Dialogue on the book

'Three Easy Pieces' is inspired by Richard Feynmann's iconic book on physics called 'Six Easy Pieces'. This book would be about 'Operating Systems'.

The three pieces considered are:
	i. Virtualization.
	ii. Concurrency.
	iii. Persistence.

As we study these concepts, we'll get to know more about Operating systems. Like how it choose a program to be executed by the CPU, how it handles memory overloads in a virtual memory system, how to manage information on disks, etc.

Each chapter comes with its homework and projects, which is essential for a student to do.
