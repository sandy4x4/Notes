Scalability

	Scalability is the system's ability to cope with an increased load without requiring a redesign. Another defintion we often see is: Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system.

	There are two ways to scale a system:

		1. Vertical Scaling / Scale Up

			We scale vertically by adding more resources (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.

		2. Horizontal Scaling / Scale-Out

			We scale horizontally by adding more systems to our pool of resources. The application should be designed to support horizontal scaling, therefore some redesign might be required to horizontally scale an application.
