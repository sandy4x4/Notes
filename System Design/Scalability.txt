Scalability

	Scalability is the system's ability to cope with an increased load without requiring a redesign.

	There are two ways to scale a system:

		1. Vertical Scaling / Scale Up

			We scale vertically by adding more resources (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.

		2. Horizontal Scaling / Scale-Out

			We scale horizontally by adding more systems to our pool of resources.
