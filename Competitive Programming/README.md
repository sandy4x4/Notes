# Competitive Programming Notes
---
&nbsp;
> These notes were made keeping competitive programming in mind. They should be used ***ONLY*** for quick reference while solving algorithmic problems and is not a substitution for 'Algorithms and Data Structures'. For that, take a proper course (I'll list some at the bottom of this note).
> To give you a gist: we only consider 'how to use an unordered_map', we aren't interested in their internal working, implementation, or analysis. 

&nbsp;
The notes are based on Antti Laaksonen's ["Competitive Programmerâ€™s Handbook"](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf).
